  * @file    swift_defaults.c
  * @brief   Default configuration data placed at 0x0807E000 (flash page 63).
  *          GCC equivalent of the IAR `#pragma location` / `__root const` arrays
  *          in the original SwiftOne_FW main.c.
  *
  *          The config utility and SwiftSettings_Get*() functions read from
  *          fixed offsets relative to SETTINGS_BASE_ADDRESS (0x0807E000).
  *          Without this data, a fresh chip has all-0xFF at those addresses,
  *          causing "Data Decoding Error — Index was outside the bounds of
  *          the array" in the config utility.
  *
  *          Layout (must match GeneralDefines.h offsets — all 16-byte aligned):
  *            +0x000  CODEC_SETTINGS_OFFSET      (24 bytes, padded to 32)
  *            +0x020  STM32_CLOCKDIV_OFFSET      (24 bytes, padded to 32)
  *            +0x040  WAVFILE_ATTRIBUTES_OFFSET   (24 bytes, padded to 32)
  *            +0x060  SCHEDULE_STARTTIMES_OFFSET  (48 bytes)
  *            +0x090  SCHEDULE_STOPTIMES_OFFSET   (48 bytes)
  *            +0x0C0  LATLONG_OFFSET              (48 bytes)
  *            +0x0F0  DST_OFFSET                  (32 bytes)
  *            +0x110  CONFIG_TEXTFILE_OFFSET     (384 bytes)
  *                                         Total: 656 bytes
